						<p><em>“Money in itself has no value – it’s an unfulfilling and futile motivation for your work. Despite the term ‘working for a living’, your job does not keep you alive and your immediate survival is not in threat if you choose to take another direction.”<br>
						Rupert Holloway, Founder, Conker Spirits</em></p>
						<div class="dash"></div>
						<p>When Rupert Holloway first decided to work for himself, he knew it would be a path paved with unknowns that would bring new meaning to his own ideas of work, success and happiness. Free from the constraints of tradition and antiquated expectations, he set about meticulously crafting, sip-by-sip, Conker - Dorset’s first Dry Gin.</p>
						<img id="conkerproduct" class="sponsor" src="img/conker_product.jpg" alt="Conker Bottle">
						<p><em>“It's up to you to choose the ladders you wish to climb, and it’s likely you won’t pick the right one first time round. The reality is, you’ll be most successful and therefore reap the most rewards, from doing the things that make you happy.”</em></p>
						<div class="dash"></div>
						<p>An intricate blend of ten select botanicals, Conker is a classic gin, led by dry Macedonian juniper heart that subtly incorporates notes of elderberries, samphire and handpicked New Forest Gorse Flowers for a deftly smooth Dorset Dry made to stand up on its own or adored over ice.</p>
						<p>It is with sincere pride Christ’s College May Ball brings Conker to Cambridge in celebration of the dedication, resiliency and creative flair of Rupert Holloway, who persevered for years to bring his dream to life.</p>
						<p>That’s the Spirit.</p>
