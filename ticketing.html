		<div id="faqs">
		<h4>How much are tickets?</h4>
		<p>Tickets for Christ’s May Ball are sold in three different categories, as follows:
		<br>- Standard: Experience Christ’s Ball 2016! £140
		<br>- Queue Jump: Skip the main queue and enter the ball first! £155
		<br>- Dining: The full ball experience, with early entry and a 4-course meal! £185</p>
		<h4>When and where are tickets on sale?</h4>
		<p>Tickets go on sale to all University members, Christ’s Alumni and Christ’s Fellows and Staff from midday Friday 22nd January until all tickets are sold out.
		<br>Tickets are exclusively available online at www.christsmayball.com</p>
		<h4>Do Christ’s College students have priority?</h4>
		<p>Yes, for the first 24 hours of the ticket sale.
		<br>Any Christ’s student applying for a ticket in this period will receive a ticket for the Ball. In addition, any first guest 	application from a Christ student will have priority over applications from students from other Colleges within this 24-hour period. Subsequent guest applications will enter the waiting list, alongside ticket applications from students from other Colleges.
		<br>Please note: you must first apply for your own ticket, before applying for any guest tickets.</p>
		<h4>What about students from other Colleges?</h4>
		<p>Students from other Colleges can apply for tickets as soon as they open – midday Friday 22nd January.
		<br>These ticket applications will enter the General Sales waiting list. After the priority window for Christ’s students has expired (i.e. midday Saturday 23rd January), remaining tickets will be allocated to those on this waiting list in a first-come first-served manner. So the earlier you apply, the better your chances are of getting a ticket to Christ’s!
		<br>Please note: you must first apply for your own ticket, before applying for any guest tickets.</p>
		<h4>What’s the maximum number of ticket applications that I can make?</h4>
		<p>Each student can make up to 4 ticket applications.</p>
		<h4>What about upgrades (i.e Queue Jump and Dining)?</h4>
		<p>Upgrades can be added to tickets once their status changes from pending to approved. For a Christ’s student’s own ticket and first guest ticket this is immediate. These upgrades will be allocated on a first-come first-serve basis. Make sure you 	apply for your tickets as close as possible to launch to avoid disappointment.</p>
		<h4>When do I have to pay for my tickets by?</h4>
		<p>Tickets must be paid for by 5pm Sunday 31st January, after which we will start to reallocate tickets to people on the waiting list.</p>
		<h4>How do I pay for my tickets?</h4>
		<p>Payment for your ticket will be by debit or credit card (securely through ‘Stripe’), subject to a 1.4%+20p fee.
		Alternatively, payment can be made through online bank transfer (BACS).
		<br>Account details for this transfer will be available to you once your ticket application for Christ’s May Ball 2016 has been approved. Please use the reference specified in your ticket application to avoid unnecessary delays.
		<br>Should you experience difficulties in payment, or cannot pay via online transfer, please contact the Ticketing Officer, Dan Karaj, at the first possible opportunity. We will of course do our best to accommodate any payment difficulties if we are made 	aware of them. However, if no payment has been received by 31st January, and you have not contacted us regarding any 	payment difficulty, Christ’s College May Ball Committee reserve the right to withdraw the offer of a ticket to Christ’s May Ball 2016.</p>
		<h4>I’m an alumnus of Christ’s. How can I get a ticket?</h4>
		<p>Alumni will first need to register to be able to use the ticketing process, in order to allow us to verify your eligibility. <br>Once this process has been completed, alumni will be able to sign in to the ticketing system with their provided email 	address and password, in order to purchase tickets for the Ball.
		<br>Please note that we only have a limited number of Alumni tickets available, therefore please do apply early to avoid disappointment.</p>
		<h4>I’m a Fellow or staff member at Christ’s. How can I get a ticket?</h4>
		<p>Applications for staff and Fellows of Christ’s College will open at midday Friday 22nd January. Fellows and staff will first need to register to use the ticketing process, in order to allow us to verify your eligibility. Once this process has been 	completed, Fellows and staff will be able to sign in to the ticketing system with their provided email address and 	password, in order to purchase tickets for the Ball.
		<br>Fellows and staff will receive emails detailing the various types of tickets that they can purchase.</p>
		<h4>I’ve changed my mind about wanting to go. Can I get a refund?</h4>
		<p>We will only offer refunds on tickets in accordance with your statutory rights.</p>
		<h4>I want to change the name on my ticket. How do I do this?</h4>
		<p>Name changes will be processed as follows:
		<br>- Before Monday 29th February - Free
		<br>- From Tuesday 1st March to Thursday 31st March - £10
		<br>- From Friday 1st April to Friday 3rd June - £20
		<br>- After Friday 3rd June – no name changes
		<br>All name change fees will be donated to charity.</p>
		<h4>How do I get into the Ball?</h4>
		<p>Cambridge University members will be required to bring their university cards in order to gain entrance to the Ball.
		<br>Non-university members will be issued with tickets to the address specified on their application, which they must bring in order to gain entry to the Ball. In addition, non-university members must bring a valid form of photographic identification (Passport, Driving Licence, UK issued identity card).
		<br>Please note failure to provide relevant identification may result in being denied entry to the Ball.</p>
		<h4>I want to make sure that I can get a ticket. Can I apply in more place than once?</h4>
		<p>For example, suppose I’m an alumnus. Can I apply for a ticket as an alumnus, as well as a ticket as a guest of a Christ’s student?
		<br>No, this is not permitted.
		<br>Any individual can only appear on one application. Any persons who attempt to submit multiple applications and are discovered risk having any ticketing applications they have made for Christ’s May Ball considered null and void.</p>
		<h4>Any other queries?</h4>
		<p>Anything else? Please get in touch with our ticketing officer, <a href="mailto:ticketing@christsmayball.com">Daniel Karaj (ticketing@christsmayball.com)</a>.</p>
